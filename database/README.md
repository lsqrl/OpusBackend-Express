## How to build the data model and generate corresponding data
Look at your system's diagram. Describe the system users and make a list of their possible actions.
Once the actions are in place, identify the entities that are needed to support these users and their actions.

Don't forget to identify the system's needs as well.

Once the Data model is design, generate different scenarios you would like to showcase.
There will be 3 types of data:
1. static data - always the same (example: list of currencies, countries in the world etc.)
2. data that comes from an API - timeseries data
3. data that gets generated by the actions of the system and its users (initially fake, later real)
